# EasyT
 
A terminal emulator in C++. EasyT displays contents of the current shell the emulator is currently in during use.

# Why?

This project was inspired by the challenges of working in unfamiliar environments, such as connecting remotely through another device. Additionally, my work often involves using a virtual machine, where minimizing resource usage is essential. In such setups, I frequently rely on the `ls` command to check directory contents before navigating. However, this disrupts workflow and clutters the terminal buffer.

# Installation & Quick Start
